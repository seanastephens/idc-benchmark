Introduction
- Why should this exist, a sales pitch
- brief list of contributions 
- This should frame current and future systems of this type; we don't know how to evaluate them well, this will be a decent way to

Related work
- mention streaming and why we are not covering it
- Other benchmarks in databases, specifically on-disk cube
  - Not applicable because not specifically spatiotemporal, etc?
- "Implementing Data Cubes Efficiently" should be cited

Benchmark
- Realistic benchmark given user sessions, best guess
- Measuring: memory, query time, build time, 
- Which data sources and why
- Which queries and why (synthetic and from user sessions)

Experiments
- Which systems (nanocubes, hashedcubes, immens, crossfilter, datavore)
- Plots, details of experiments (compiling, machine, how many times, more detail is better)
- Interpretation of results

Discussion (of paper)
- What did we not do
  - how to improve this
  - what did we miss
  - Different interface/system induces different user behavior (cite Jeff Heer, The effects of interactive latency on explorative visual analysis)
  - Can be extended to new data, hopefully new queries

Conclusion and Future Work
- What this means for making new systems (easier, negative space)
- What next (making things parameterizable, what is the next research question)
