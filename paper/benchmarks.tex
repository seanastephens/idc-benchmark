Data cubes are a useful tool for exploring aggregates of high dimensional data
\cite{data_cubes}. However, executing queries on data cubes of large datasets
fast enough to support an interactive user interface is technically difficult
because current systems use excessive memory usage or demand a high degree of
parallelism \cite{nanocubes, parallel_paper}.

To address these problems, systems such as \textit{Nanocubes} and
\textit{Hashedcubes} allow fast queries in several dimensions by storing the
dataset in a server-side structure on dedicated hardware
\cite{nanocube}\cite{hashedcube}. This approach is much more complex and
resources intensive than simpler approaches such as linear scans on a client,
as in \textit{datavore} and \textit{crossfilter} \cite{datavore,crossfilter}.
On the other hand, it allows interactive exploration of data sets of tens of
millions of points. Alternatively, appropriate limits on the resolution or dimensionality of the dataset can reduce query latency to interactive rates, as is done in \textit{imMens} \cite{imMens}. 

Each of these systems were published with performance information exercising
the system on real-world test data. However, the published performance measures
are not, in general, comparable. Different datasets were used, and critical
parameters such as field resolution differ. As such, there is no complete
picture of data/schema configurations each of these systems is best suited for,
nor how each scales in different configurations.

This paper contributes a benchmark that allows direct comparisons of the query
performance of these systems on realistic data. Additionally, we describe an
implementation for nanocubes and hashedcubes. Finally, we
give guidance for choosing between and configuring these systems based on
dataset and application.


\section{Related work}
Large data visualization frequently requires computing aggregations over the
entirety of a dataset to produce counts, histograms, and density plots
\cite{?}. For an interactive visualization, supporting arbitrary aggregations
smoothly on large datasets presents a problem due to performance. To maintain
an interactive user experience, a plot of aggregates should refresh with low
latency (This is not merely an aesthetic concern; high latency induces large
changes in a user's exploration to the detriment of analysis, as explored in
\cite{2014-latency} \FIXME{Inline citation here?}). However, naive techniques
for computing aggregations, namely linear scans over the dataset, do not scale
to datasets with tens of millions of entries.

\subsection{Existing Systems}

Several solutions exist for this problem. Nanocubes builds a
hierarchical tree of agregations that fits in main memory, in contrast to
traditional relational database data cube aggregations which must be stored on
disk \cite{nanocubes}. This system provides query performance that is fast
enough for interactive applications and suports queries at different
resolutions (up to the limits of the underlying data), but is memory intensive.

A new alternative to nanocubes is hashedcubes. This system
achieves similar performance for many common queries but consumes less memory
by using a single sorted array, at the cost of poor performance in some cases.
Additionally, it does not allow fine queries in sparsely populated areas, as a
tradeoff to prevent poor performance in other areas.

\textit{ImMens} pre-computes and compactly stores aggregates as so-called
``data-tiles.'' These tiles can be quickly queried using the GPU on the client.
ImMens achieves very fast response time (limited by the GPU refresh
rate) and does not require a dedicated server, but requires pre-computing data
tiles and limits on the resolution and dimensionality of the underlying data.

An alternate solution to this performance challenge is sampling.
\textit{BlinkDB} uses parallelism and intelligent sampling strategies to
achieve approximate query results with $2-10\%$ error and response times on the
order of $2$ seconds \cite{blinkdb}. This system is designed for datasets on
the order of terabytes in size, but does not provide response times fast enough
for an interactive application \FIXME{In the sense we are describing -- should
specify this more carefully}. For datasets with tens to hundreds of millions of
points, the previously described systems can produce much more accurate results
using less time and resources. For this reason, we will not benchmark sampling
systems here. \FIXME{This hardly seems like a comprehensive treatment of
sampling systems -- need to look at more references}

Finally, for small datasets with $1-5$ million elements, it is possible to do
queries at near interactive latencies in a web browser. Systems such as
\textit{datavore} and \textit{crossfilter} take this approach
\cite{crossfilter,datavore}. While this approach does not scale to tens and
hundreds of millions of data points due to latency and bandwidth consumption,
it is a simple solution for small datasets. 

In this paper we will describe a benchmark aimed at nanocubes, hashedcubes,
imMens, and crossfilter/datavore. Despite the performance measurements reported
in publications for these systems, it is not possible to definitively state how
each of these systems perform relative to each other. It is similarly not
well-understood how each of these systems scale with dataset size,
dimensionality, and query distribution. Our contribution is to rectify this
situation and provide guidance for choosing between these systems for
applications.
