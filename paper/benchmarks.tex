\abstract{The data cube is a convenient abstraction for exploring
	multi-dimensional datasets. However, exploring large datasets as data cubes
	at interactive speeds requires specialized data structures and systems.
	Such systems exist, but there is no comprehensive comparison of these

	synthetic spatiotemporal data to explore the performance of these systems
	on realistic query sets.  We compare four existing systems using our
	implementation and demonstrate performance differences between them.
	Finally, we give a set of guidelines for choosing a system for

Data cubes are a useful tool for exploring aggregates of high dimensional data
\cite{data_cubes}. However, executing queries on data cubes of large datasets
fast enough to support an interactive user interface is technically difficult
because current systems use excessive memory usage or demand a high degree of
parallelism \cite{nanocubes, parallel_paper}.

To address these problems, systems such as \textit{Nanocubes} and
\textit{Hashedcubes} allow fast queries in several dimensions by storing the
dataset in a server-side structure on dedicated hardware
\cite{nanocube}\cite{hashedcube}. This approach is much more complex and
resources intensive than simpler approaches such as linear scans on a client,
as in \textit{datavore} and \textit{crossfilter} \cite{datavore,crossfilter}.
On the other hand, it allows interactive exploration of data sets of tens of
millions of points. \FIXME{If we get imMens working we need to talk about that
too.}

Each of these systems were published with performance information exercising
the system on real-world test data. However, the published performance measures
are not, in general, comparable. Different datasets were used, and critical
parameters such as field resolution differ. As such, there is no complete
picture of data/schema configurations each of these systems is best suited for,
nor how each scales in different configurations.

This paper contributes a benchmark that allows direct comparisons of the query
performance of these systems on realistic data. Additionally, we describe an
implementation for \textit{nanocubes} and \textit{hashedcubes}. Finally, we
give guidance for choosing between and configuring these systems based on
dataset and application.


\section{Related work}
Large data visualization frequently requires computing aggregations over the
entirety of a dataset to produce counts, histograms, and density plots
\cite{?}. For an interactive visualization, supporting arbitrary aggregations
smoothly on large datasets presents a problem due to performance. To maintain
an interactive user experience, a plot of aggregates should refresh with low
latency (This is not merely an aesthetic concern; high latency induces large
changes in a user's exploration to the detriment of analysis, as explored in
\cite{2014-latency} \FIXME{Inline citation here?}). However, naive techniques
for computing aggregations, namely linear scans over the dataset, do not scale
to datasets with tens of millions of entries.

Several solutions exist for this problem. \textit{Nanocubes} builds a
hierarchical tree of agregations that fits in main memory, in contrast to
traditional relational database data cube aggregations which must be stored on
disk \cite{nanocubes}. This system provides query performance that is fast
enough for interactive applications, but is memory intensive.
\textit{hashedcubes} achieves similar performance for many common queries but
consumes less memory by using a single sorted array, at the cost of poor
performance in some cases.

\FIXME{Talk about some/all of parallel systems, imMens, crossfilter, datavore}.
